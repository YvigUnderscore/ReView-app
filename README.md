ReView is an open-source, secure, and self-hostable video collaboration platform. Designed as a free and accessible alternative to well known tools, it enables creators, studios, and teams to review their video projects with precision and efficiency.

The project emphasizes data privacy (your files stay with you) and ease of use.
