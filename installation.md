# Installation and Setup

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

## Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables to be set (e.g., in a `.env` file):
- **⚠️⚠️`JWT_SECRET`**: A strong, random string used to sign authentication tokens. **Required.**⚠️⚠️
- **`DATA_PATH`**: Path to store application data (defaults to internal storage).
### Optionnal variables:
- **`PORT`**: If needed you can change the default front-end value (**3429**) of your instance.
- **`BPORT`**: If needed you can change the default front-end value (**3430**) of your instance.
## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YvigUnderscore/ReView-app.git
   cd ReView-app
   ```
2. **Create and add to your .env file your JWT_Secret & DATA_PATH variables**
   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=
   DATA_PATH=
   ```

3. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

4. **Access the interface:**
    Open your browser at `http://localhost:3429` (or the port you configured).

## Configuration
- **First Account:** The first user to register automatically becomes the **Administrator**.
- **Invitations:** Registration is invitation-only, generated by an admin.
- **Storage:** Data is stored locally (Docker volume or configured folder).

## SMTP Configuration

You can configure your mail server for sending invitations and notifications in the Admin Dashboard.

The application offers presets for common providers:
- **OVH**: Selecting "OVH" will automatically fill the fields (Host: `ssl0.ovh.net`, Port: `465`, Security: `SSL/TLS`).
- **Gmail** and **Outlook** are also available.
- You can always enter a **Custom** configuration.

## 3D Import
To import a 3D model with separate textures:
1. Create a ZIP file containing:
   - Your `.glb/.gltf/.fbx` file.
   - Your textures (in the same folder or subfolders, as long as relative links in the 3D model are correct).
2. Select the "3D Asset" option when creating a project or uploading a version.
3. Upload the ZIP file.
