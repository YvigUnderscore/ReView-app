# Installation and Setup

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

## Environment Variables
The application requires the following environment variables to be set (e.g., in a `.env` file):
- `JWT_SECRET`: A strong, random string used to sign authentication tokens. **Required.**
- `DATA_PATH`: Path to store application data (defaults to internal storage).
- `PORT`: If needed you can change the default value (3429) of your instance.
## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YvigUnderscore/ReView-app.git
   cd ReView-app
   ```

2. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

    *Note: You can change the port by adding `PORT=YOUR_PORT` to your `.env` file. Default is 3429.*

3. **Access the interface:**
    Open your browser at `http://localhost:3429` (or the port you configured).

## Configuration
- **First Account:** The first user to register automatically becomes the **Administrator**.
- **Invitations:** Registration is invitation-only, generated by an admin.
- **Storage:** Data is stored locally (Docker volume or configured folder).

## SMTP Configuration

You can configure your mail server for sending invitations and notifications in the Admin Dashboard.

The application offers presets for common providers:
- **OVH**: Selecting "OVH" will automatically fill the fields (Host: `ssl0.ovh.net`, Port: `465`, Security: `SSL/TLS`).
- **Gmail** and **Outlook** are also available.
- You can always enter a **Custom** configuration.

## 3D Import
To import a 3D model with separate textures:
1. Create a ZIP file containing:
   - Your `.glb` file.
   - Your textures (in the same folder or subfolders, as long as relative links in the GLB are correct).
2. Select the "3D Asset" option when creating a project or uploading a version.
3. Upload the ZIP file.
